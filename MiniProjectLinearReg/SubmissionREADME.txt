README:

There are two primary documents to pay attention to.

1. Exercise_final.R

This is the code, clean and finished. If you want to assess my understanding of the topic and the outcome of the analysis, view this document only. It includes some of the models and approaches I experimented with. It removes unecessary code. For example, instead of showing...

> nrow(states.data)
> class(states.data)
> str(states.data)

... It shows only:

> str(states.data)


2. Exercise_play.R

If you want to see some of the experimentation I did, thought comments, and code superflous to a final submission (but not to my learning and experimentation),  then read this.

The two documents (very) roughly parallel each other in order of code.
